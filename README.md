# @Bodacious

Hi, I'm Gavin, a.k.a Bodacious. I'm a full-stack Ruby on Rails developer from Scotland.

## Where I work

Practically all of the work I do, is done as part of my small company [Katana][katana]. We are a web and mobile app development team that specialises in getting startups to market. You can think of us as your _external_, "in-house" development team.

You can contact us here: [https://katanacode.com/contact/](https://katanacode.com/#call_to_action)

## Planning your own startup?

If you have an idea for an app or web-based business, you should check out this free guide: [App Starter](https://app-starter.co.uk/). It will help you organise your thoughts and ask yourself the right questions, before you start the (potentially) expensive development phase.

Bodacious is the name of one of the most famous rodeo bulls in history, but it's also a song by one of my all-time favourite bands, Primus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lP6rfkIcWc
