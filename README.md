## Why 'Bodacious'? 🐂

  <dt>Bodacious (/boʊˈdeɪʃəs/)</dt>
  <dd><em>[adjective]</em>&mdash;Audacious in a way considered admirable.</dd>

Bodacious is the name of one of the most famous rodeo bulls in history, but it's also a song by one of my all-time favourite bands, Primus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lP6rfkIcWc
